	  <p>Monodisperse polymeric microspheres have diverse applications in biomedical fields due to their excellent properties such as large specific surface areas, strong absorbability and ability to be modified by various functional groups. Quantum dots (QDs), which possess unique optical properties and outstanding photochemical stability, have been regarded as one of the most promising biolabeling materials. The QD-polymer composite microspheres received a great deal of attention, since they could combine advantages of both materials.</p><br>

      <span class="glink"> <b> introduction </b></strong><br>
	  <p>MQuantum dots (QDs) or semiconductor nanocrystals are of great interest to fundamental studies and potential applications as fluorescent probes, fluorescent biosensors, lightemitting diodes (LEDs), and solar cells. Recently, introducing transition metal ions into the intrinsic QDs has been widely explored because of the unique optical properties of the d-dots. The d-dots not only retain nearly all the advantages of intrinsic QDs but also possess new properties such as the enhancement of the thermal stability, the reduction of the chemical sensitivity, and the elimination of the self-quenching and re-absorption due to enlarged Stokes shift caused by absorption/energy transfer. Mn2+:ZnSe QD is one of the most popular d-dots because of its cadmium free, remarkable magneto-optical properties and the long fluorescence lifetime of the Mn2+ emission suitable for broad applications. The cadmium-free doped quantum dots prepared in aqueous environment are great materials for bio-application because of its low toxicity and hydrophilic nature.</p><br>

      </h1>
      <span class="glink"> <b> introduction </b></strong><br>
	  <p>Self-quenching and reabsorption problem and phosphor scattering problem are two main problems of quantum dots application in WLED. Doped quantum dots coated with a silica cell may be a solution. Doped QDs not only retain nearly all the advantages associated with intrinsic QDs but also possess new properties such as enhanced thermal stability and reduced chemical sensitivity. Doped QDs also have enlarged Stokes shifts due to absorption/energy transfer, eliminating the previously mentioned self-quenching and reabsorption problems. Besides, Additional surface treatment of QDs, in particular coating of QDs with a silica shell, can help prevent aggregation. Since the refraction index of epoxy resin (~1.5244) is between that of
silica(~1.4245) and ZnSe(~2.8946), it can be expected that a transparent doped ZnSe QDs@SiO2/epoxy composite could be developed by adjusting the ratios of the components, allowing the composite to act as both a light conversion and encapsulant material while simultaneously preventing aggregation of the QDs.
</p><br>
	  <span class="glink"> <b> purpose </b></strong><br>
	  <p>1)	Fabricate WLED without self-quenching effect and the reabsorption problem<br>2)	Adjust the refractive index of quantum dots and reduce the energy loss by coating with a silica shell, and fabricate successfully high-performance WLED <br>
 
	  <span class="glink">  <b>results </b></strong><br>
	  <p>1)	Successfully prepare Mn:ZnSe and Cu:ZnSe quantum dots with three colors, and there are few overlaps between the PL and UV-vis spectra of the Cu and Mn doped ZnSe with different emission wavelengths.<br>2)	Coated quantum dots with silica and reduce the refractive index of quantum dots and epoxy resin by 93%<br>3)	fabricate successfully high-performance WLED</p>
